            <h3>What is UV radiation?</h3>
            <p>Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a form of electromagnetic radiation that comes from the sun and man-made
                sources like tanning beds and welding torches.Ultraviolet (UV) light has shorter wavelengths than
                visible light. Although UV waves are invisible to the human eye, some insects, such as bumblebees, can
                see them. This is similar to how a dog can hear the sound of a whistle just outside the hearing range of
                humans.</p>
